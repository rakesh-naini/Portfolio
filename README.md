## How To Use 

From your command line, clone and run developerFolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone 

# Go into the repository
cd developerFolio

# Setup default environment variables

# For Linux
cp env.example .env
# For Windows
copy env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start a local dev server
npm start
```

## Linking Portfolio to GitHub

Generate a classic GitHub personal access token following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) (make sure you don't select any scope just generate a simple token). If you are using [GitHub Actions](#configuring-github-actions-recommended) to deploy your portfolio you can skip this section.

1. Create a file called .env in the root directory of your project (if not done already in section: [How To Use](#how-to-use))

Note: Configuring environment variables before deploying your portfolio is highly recommended as some components depend on API data. 

```bash
- DeveloperFolio
  - node_modules
  - public
  - src
  - .env         <-- create it here
  - env.example  <-- this is the base file
  - .gitignore
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
```

2. Inside the .env file, add key `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` and assign your GitHub token like this, also add your username as `GITHUB_USERNAME`

```env
// .env
REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR GITHUB TOKEN HERE"
GITHUB_USERNAME = "YOUR GITHUB USERNAME"
USE_GITHUB_DATA = "true"
```



## Change and customize every section according to your need.

#### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need. You will also need to modify `index.html` to change the title and metadata to provide accurate SEO for your personal portfolio.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */

const greeting = {
  /* Your Summary And Greeting Section */
  title: "Hi all I'm Rakesh",
  subTitle: emoji("A passionate Full Stack Software Developer 🚀"),
  resumeLink: ""
};

const socialMediaLinks = {
  /* Your Social Media Link */
  github: "",
  linkedin: "",
  gmail: "",
  gitlab: "",
  facebook: ""
};


const skillsSection = { .... }

const techStack = { .... }

const workExperience = { .... }

const openSource = { .... }

const bigProjects = { .... }

const achievementSection = { .... }

const blogSection = { .... }

const contactInfo = { .... }



```
#### Resume upload
To upload your own resume, simply upload a pdf to `src/containers/resume` and rename the pdf to `resume.pdf`. 

#### Using Emojis

For adding emoji 😃 into the texts in `Portfolio.js`, use the `emoji()` function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

#### Customize Lottie Animations

You can choose a Lottie and download it in json format from sites like [this](https://lottiefiles.com/). In `src/assets/lottie`, replace the Lottie json file you want to alter with the same file name. If you want to change the Lottie options, go to `src/components/displayLottie/DisplayLottie.js` and change the `defaultOptions` object, you can refer [lottie-react docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-react) for more info on the `defaultOptions` object.
